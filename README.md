# DevOps + AIOps Series

> A full end-to-end DevOps project with AIOps integration that can connect the dots between how AI is helping automate DevOps tasks today.

---

## Welcome

Hey everyone!

Welcome to my DevOps + AI project where we build an end-to-end DevOps project with an AIOps integration.

In this project we will:

- Build microservices locally
- Use Claude and AI tools to assist development
- Deploy everything step by step
- Migrate the system to the cloud on AWS EKS
- Set up a full CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Implement GitOps workflows with ArgoCD
- Integrate AIOps capabilities with AWS Bedrock

## Series Structure

### Claude Setup — AI Assistant Configuration
[`docs/claude-setup.md`](docs/claude-setup.md)

this step walks through how Claude Code is configured as the AI assistant throughout this series.

Three things are set up:

**CLAUDE.md** — a project instruction file at the repo root that Claude reads automatically at the start of every session. It puts Claude in safe execution mode: explain what you're about to do and why before taking any action. This is important when working with live AWS infrastructure where silent commands can have real consequences.

**MCP Servers** — background processes that extend Claude's built-in capabilities. Four servers are configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

| Server | What it unlocks |
|--------|----------------|
| `awslabs.eks-mcp-server` | Query EKS clusters, inspect pods, stream logs, apply manifests |
| `awslabs.terraform-mcp-server` | Run Terraform commands, search provider docs, run Checkov scans |
| `awslabs.aws-pricing-mcp-server` | Live AWS pricing lookups and cost analysis reports |
| `awslabs.core-mcp-server` | MCP orchestration layer (deprecated, kept for compatibility) |

**Skills** — domain-specific knowledge packs that improve how Claude reasons about certain topics. The `terraform-skill` is installed, giving Claude deeper context for Terraform module patterns, testing strategies, security scanning, and CI/CD workflows specific to infrastructure-as-code.

### Part 2 — Understanding the Workflow
[`docs/part2-workflow.md`](docs/part2-workflow.md)

Before writing any code or deployment configs, you need to understand how the entire system flows:

- What services we're building and how they communicate
- How the pipeline works
- How code moves from developer → CI → deployment → production → AIOps

This is where the full picture comes together — including how AI fits into the workflow.

---

### Part 3 — DevOps Project Implementation
[`projects/README.md`](projects/README.md)

Then we actually build the project

- Docker containers and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes deployments on EKS
- CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- GitOps automation with ArgoCD
- Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform
- Observability with Prometheus and Grafana

---

### Part 4 — AIOps Integration
[`projects/aiops-assistant/README.md`](projects/aiops-assistant/README.md)

Finally, we explore how AI helps with:

- Monitoring and anomaly detection
- Log analysis at scale
- Incident response automation
- DevOps troubleshooting

Because modern DevOps is no longer just automation — it's **automation + intelligence**.
